# Installation

- [Have go installed](https://golang.org) _(duh?)_
- Install with go: `go get github.com/integrii/serve`
- If your `$PATH` environment variable has `$GO?BIN` in it, then you can now simply use `serve`
  - Otherwise, you will need to run `$GOBIN/serve` or if you don't even have `$GOBIN` set, you must run `$GOPATH/bin/serve`

# Usage

- Run `serve`.
- See results at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- Hit `Control-C` to stop the server gracefully
